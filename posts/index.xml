      <description>Cloud lifecycle is a complex process that involves several procedures such as maintenance and upgrades. These operations mostly include migration of workloads. OpenStack provides several options to perform such moving:
 Cold migration Live migrations Instance rebuilds  From the list above only live migration allows moving an instance from one host to another with almost zero downtime, which is done seamlessly for the instance itself.
